# Sign-Language-Annotation-Detection-using-ML-model
This project is able to detect 6 sign language annotations. The model has been trained using YOLO version 8 and can detect annotations like : Hello, Yes, No, Thank You, Please and I Love You. The oredictions made by the model are about 80-90% accurate and the real time detections also provide a satisfying result.
